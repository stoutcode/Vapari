# Vapari
"Vapaaehtoistyön rekisteri" (Register for volunteer work)

Vapari is program with GUI to keep record of volunteer workers, customers and interactions between them.

As it is, there are two imaginary registers ready for testing. By default you can access the register named Jyväskylä.

Done with Java and JavaFX. I utilized also SceneBuilder to create JavaFX elements.

To run the program (vapari.jar), you need to install JavaFX 11 or later alongside with jdk 11 or later.

After unpacking the JavaFX to for example C:\devel\javafx\ you can run the
program from command line:
`javaw --module-path c:\devel\javafx\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar vapari.jar`
